## Causal Graph Learning via Distributional Invariance of Cause-Effect Relationship

This repository contains the Python implementation for the paper "Causal Graph Learning via Distributional Invariance of Cause-Effect Relationship".

We have prepare a bash file **run.sh** that can be executed using *bash run.sh*.<br>
This experiment is conducted on the Sachs dataset (realworld), link: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1105809. 

The generating code for data in the folder **categorical** can be found in the ./utils folder. The code for data in the folder **notears** can be fetched from the following github: https://github.com/xunzheng/notears [1]
